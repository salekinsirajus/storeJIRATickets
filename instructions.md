## Instructions
The customer wishes to build a system storing summary information about their
internal JIRA tickets.  In short, the system will:

- [ ] Receive POST notifications from JIRA
- [x] Store relevant fields from the notifications
- [x] If applicable, calculate the time between ticket created and ticket closed
- [x] Provide an ability to retrieve the records via a GET request.
 

Below is the sample payload containing only the fields of interest. 

```
{

  "summary" : "",

  "created": "2018-01-10T20:15:07.958Z",

  "completed": "", // Date time the ticket was closed.

  "description" : "",

  "priority" : "Major" 

}
```


### Technical limitations.  
* Must be implemented in Python and hosted as AWS Lambdas
* You must use DynamoDB as your datastore.

### Notes:
* Put all your region-specific resources in the US-West (Oregon) region
You do not need a real JIRA instance if you donâ€™t have one readily available;
you can simulate the POST call however you wish

### Hints:
* Serverless Framework https://serverless.com/ (optional, but major extra credit
kudos)

* You will need to use more AWS services than mentioned above
 
### Submission
This project should be completable within the AWS free tier.  To submit:

- include a READ.me file in the Github repo that at least briefly
  lists/describes the AWS services you choose to use
